{"body":"What\r\n----\r\n\r\nSuperfast replacement for 2 functions form the python base64 module. Provided are functions that can replace `base64.b64encode()` and `base64.encodestring()`.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n----\r\n\r\nWell, agree that normally running a function such as this in 0.00001 or 0.000001 seconds does not really make a difference, but if you have some time sensitive and/or massive processing going on, 10x improvement can mean a lot\r\n\r\nHow\r\n---\r\n\r\n### ... to install\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:KillerX/ft_base64.git\r\n$ sudo python setyp.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ... to use\r\n\r\nThe functions are almost drop in replacement.\r\n\r\nOtherwise here is an example:\r\n```python\r\nimport ft\r\nimport base64\r\n\r\n\"\"\"ft.base64 behaves identically to base64.b64encode\"\"\"\r\nshortString = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!!\"\r\na = base64.b64encode(shortString)\r\nb = ft.base64(shortString)\r\n\r\n\"\"\"ft.base64string behaves similarly to base64.encodestring. \r\nSee lines below for the difference\"\"\"\r\nft.base64string(\"FOO\")\r\nbase64.encodestring(\"BAR\").replace(\"\\n\", \"\\r\\n\").strip()\r\n```","name":"Ft base64","tagline":"A python module replacing the native base64.encodestring()","note":"Don't delete this file!
